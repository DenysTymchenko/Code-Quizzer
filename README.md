## About

**Code Quizzer** is a pet-project created to learn React:  how it works and what it's capable of. It was made within one month and works as basic demonstration of my skills.

### Here you can: 
1. Complete quizzes to test your knowledge of different programming languages.
2. Set quizzes as favorites, so you can always access your favorite ones on a separate page in the future.
3. Fill in the basic fields to create a base for a new quiz.

## Easter Eggs

I really love finding Easter eggs in anything (videogames, movies, etc.). It's a thing that provides a fun experience and adds soul to a project.

So, I decided to add a few of them to my project as well:
<details>
  <summary>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</summary>
  
  When you happen to reach the 404 page, you will see some atypical text:
  
  > You have reached the world's edge. None but devils play past here... Turn back.

  This is the text that players can see in The Witcher 3 game when they reach the end of the map.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Konami code</summary>

  If you press legendary combination of
  >Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A

  You'll get... Nothing!
  Well... At least you'll see a really nice page made especially for those who know about that Easter egg.
